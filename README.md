A script that adds a bunch of distracting sites to the `hosts` file <s>and redirect their URLs to a motivational page instead</s>.

The sites to block are listed in *[sites-to-block.txt](sites-to-block.txt)*.

This script borrows heavily from [Alex Payne's Get-Back-To-Work Hack](https://al3x.net/2009/09/14/my-get-back-to-work-hack.html) and [Vic Cherubini's get-shit-done](https://github.com/leftnode/get-shit-done) script.


## Usage/Installation


### Alfred Workflow

If you use Alfred and want to toggle Hey! Focus! that way, **[download the HeyFocus.alfredworkflow](raw/master/Hey!%20Focus!.alfredworkflow)** and install it. You will be asked for your admin password when running the script (and the dialog that asks you for it won't get focus, which is very annoying.)

If you want to add to or delete sites from the list of those to block, right-click on the workflow in the list of Alfred workflows, choose 'Show in Finder', and edit the *sites-to-block.txt* file.


### Command Line

**[Download this repository](archive/master.zip)**, stick it in a folder somewhere, and add an alias to it in your shell resource file, like this:

```sh
alias focus="sudo sh ~/Scripts/heyfocus/heyfocus.sh"
```

Then you can call `focus` on the command line at any time to block or unblock your distracting sites.

If you want to add to or delete sites from the list of those to block, edit the *sites-to-block.txt* file.


## What About Redirecting to a Specific URL?

Like Alex Payne [suggests](https://al3x.net/2009/09/14/my-get-back-to-work-hack.html). But I can't do this! I use `127.0.0.1` for my webroot and don't want to put an index file in there with a motivational messageâ€”I want to see my list of folders. It's not possible to redirect to a specific URL with `/etc/hosts`; only an IP address. Theoretically, I could use MAMP to set up a port like 127.0.0.1:5555 that goes to a specific directory, then direct something like 127.0.0.2 to that using [local port forwarding with `pf`](https://gist.github.com/kujohn/7209628), but that's getting pretty hairy.
